A state of the art End to End M&A application (Marketplace where sellers can sell their business to buyers in a transparent and easy to understand way. Buyers can buy a business with the complete understanding of what they are purchasing. All parties can identify, understand, and act on all parts of the M&A process with as little headache as possible.) IT all starts with the seller simply uploading the appropriate financial documents to get an unbiased Ai analysis of their company. The company will be added to our class leading marketplace with a full business profile where buyer can pull all of the high level data on the companies that they are interested in purchasing. Once the buyer is serious about the purchase the buyer can reach out to the seller to initiate the NDA and request for additional information. The application supports the rest of the process from Discussions, Negotiations, Due diligence (with a Virtual Data Room), Sell, and Post Purchase Integration.

In addtion to these features the application will have a Deal Search Page, and a Deal Entry Page (page where you upload financial documents to Supabase and use Open Ai to analyze the files), Individualized Deal Profile Page, Community Section and Resource Section for those that want to grow as M&A professionals and business owners.
